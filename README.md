# Rubber Duck Programming Language
A project created for our Programming Language Course. 

This software is a lexer and parser that parses our custom progamming language _**Rubber Duck!**_ 
It accepts a file with the code and reads each token and defines what it is in Rubber Duck language. It also prints the error that it sees in the code.

Built using Javascript and NodeJS
